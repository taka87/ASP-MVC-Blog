        <h1>History of Rock Music</h1>

        <p>
            The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll,
            which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s,
            and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world.
            Its immediate origins lay in a melding of various black musical genres of the time,
            including rhythm and blues and gospel music, with country and western.In 1951, Cleveland,
            Ohio disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music (then termed "race music")
            for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase "rock and roll" to describe the music.
            Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct subgenres, including rockabilly,
            combining rock and roll with "hillbilly" country music,
            which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as Carl Perkins,
            Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly and with the greatest commercial success, Elvis Presley.
